# Digital Bank Analytics

working with a Python script that scrapes Google Play Store data for several banking apps, processes this information, and performs some analysis. You want to implement this as a Flask web application with a modern UI/UX to display the data tables and analysis.

Let me create a plan for this project:
Build the initial prototype:
- Add more advanced sentiment analysis with entity recognition
- Implement scheduled scraping to track app metrics over time
- Add comparative analysis between different banking apps
- Create export functionality for reports in PDF/CSV formats

✓ Home page with app listing and data visualization
✓ App details page showing comprehensive app information
✓ Reviews analysis with sentiment analysis visualization
✓ About page explaining the project
✓ Added input field for custom app URLs/IDs on home page
✓ Implemented JavaScript for adding/removing apps dynamically
✓ Created visual table to display added apps
✓ Added validation for app URLs in backend routes
✓ Improved error handling for custom app IDs
